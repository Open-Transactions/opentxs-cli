// NOTE: This function has nothing to do with placing a new offer. Instead,
// as a convenience for knotwork, it first checks to see if there are any
// existing offers within certain parameters based on this new one, and
// removes them if so. Only then, after that is done, does it actually place
// the new offer. (Meaning: most of the code you see here at first is not
// actually necessary for placing offers, but was done at the request of a
// server operator.)

// me: How about this... when you do "opentxs newoffer" I can alter that script
// to automatically cancel any sell offers for a lower amount than my new buy
// offer, if they're on the same market at the same scale. And vice versa.
// Vice versa meaning, cancel any bid offers for a higher amount than my new
// sell offer.
//
// knotwork: yeah that would work.
//
// So when placing a buy offer, check all the other offers I already have at
// the same scale, same asset and currency ID. (That is, the same "market" as
// denoted by strMapKey in "opentxs showmyoffers") For each, see if it's a sell
// offer and if so, if the amount is lower than the amount on the new buy offer,
// then cancel that sell offer from the market. (Because I don't want to
// buy-high, sell-low.)
//
// Similarly, if placing a sell offer, then check all the other offers I already
// have at the same scale, same asset and currency ID, (the same "market" as
// denoted by strMapKey....) For each, see if it's a buy offer and if so, if
// the amount is higher than the amount of my new sell offer, then cancel that
// buy offer from the market. (Because I don't want some old buy offer for $10
// laying around for the same stock that I'm SELLING for $8! If I dump 100
// shares, I'll receive $800 --I don't want my software to automatically turn
// around and BUY those same shares again for $1000! That would be a $200 loss.)
